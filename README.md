# Nonopinionated

In the world of today’s political news, can any of the articles be trusted on face value? It is increasability hard today to disseminate which articles are biased intended and which ones are not.

Non-opinionated is a software platform that is going to help readers see the biases in their political news article coverage and enable them to make their own conclusions. 

To provide readers with that ability, Non-opinionated will allow the reader to know more about the author. The knowledge would not be limited to the author’s political views, social media political stands, previous articles, and sentiment/use of words throughout the article.

In essence, Non-opinionated goal is to allow readers to uncover the biases and allow the reader to make his/her conclusions of the political event. 

Non-opinionated is currently in its first stage of development. Feel free to join the team in helping bring transparency to our political news coverage.
